abstract: Noise can have serious adverse effects on residents' physical and
  mental health. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Westminster in London
  has seen a continuous increase in noise complaints, with a significant number
  of repeat complaints from the same address within a short time scale. The
  authorities' ability to respond to complaints is challenged. This study
  explores a method for predicting and identifying repeat complaints to improve
  the efficiency of the authorities in dealing with noise complaints. Taking the
  noise complaint records of the City of Westminster during 2018–2022 as
  research objects, the research explores the cumulative distribution
  characteristics and clustering pattern of noise complaints in different
  spatial and temporal dimensions. On this basis, for a noise complaint from a
  specific address, the study fits random forest classifiers to predict whether
  the same address is likely to have another noise complaint in future time
  scales. It is found that about 18.5% of all complaints had at least one
  previous complaint at the same address in the previous 7 days; during the
  lock-down period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, areas with active commercial
  activities and higher housing prices experienced a significant decrease in
  complaints, while areas adjacent to parks and green spaces can share a similar
  upward trend in noise complaints. Prediction of repeat noise complaints with
  random forest classifiers is proved feasible. F1 scores of models to predict
  repeat complaints within 0 to 2nd days, 0 to 7th days and 0 to 30th days in
  the future are 0.55, 0.66 and 0.75, respectively. Suggestions are provided for
  local authorities to improve resource allocation related to noise complaint
  management.
